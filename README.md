# Examining Response Processes in the Measurement of Personality Functioning (SRP 2023)
A repository for my research poster (**"Examining Response Processes in the Measurement of Personality Functioning"**) presented at the 2023 Society for Research in Psychopathology (SRP) conference. This repo contains information regarding the background/results of the research project and supplemental files (i.e., R syntax and output for item-level statistics, actual poster, response process question prompts).
